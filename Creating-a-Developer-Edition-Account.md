---
In this module, you create a Developer Edition Account that provides you with a full-featured but isolated Salesforce environment to perform the exercises in this workshop.

### Steps

1. Open a browser and access the following URL: http://developer.salesforce.com/join

2. Fill in the signup form:
  - Enter your First Name and Last Name.
  - For **Email**, enter an email address you can access now (you will need to open an activation email).
  - For **Username**, specify a unique user name in the form of an email address. for example: **firsname.lastname@s1workshop.com** (The user name doesn't have to be an existing email address: it is is not used to send you emails).
  - Enter the captcha value, check the Master Subscription Agreement checkbox and click the **Sign Me Up** button.

3. Check your email. You will receive an activation email for your Developer Edition account.

4. Click the link in the activation email. Enter your new password information, and click **Save**.
